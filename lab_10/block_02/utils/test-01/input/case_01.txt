He hung up his black-beetle-coloured helmet and shined it, he hung his flameproof jacket neatly;
he showered luxuriously, and then, whistling, hands in pockets, walked across the upper floor of
the fire station and fell down the hole. At the last moment, when disaster seemed positive, he
pulled his hands from his pockets and broke his fall by grasping the golden pole. He slid to a
squeaking halt, the heels one inch from the concrete floor downstairs.
He walked out of the fire station and along the midnight street toward the subway where the
silent, air-propelled train slid soundlessly down its lubricated flue in the earth and let him out
with a great puff of warm air an to the cream-tiled escalator rising to the suburb.
Whistling, he let the escalator waft him into the still night air. He walked toward the comer,
thinking little at all about nothing in particular. Before he reached the corner, however, he
slowed as if a wind had sprung up from nowhere, as if someone had called his name.
The last few nights he had had the most uncertain feelings about the sidewalk just around the
corner here, moving in the starlight toward his house. He had felt that a moment before his
making the turn, someone had been there. The air seemed charged with a special calm as if
someone had waited there, quietly, and only a moment before he came, simply turned to a
shadow and let him through. Perhaps his nose detected a faint perfume, perhaps the skin on the
backs of his hands, on his face, felt the temperature rise at this one spot where a person's
standing might raise the immediate atmosphere ten degrees for an instant. There was no 
understanding it. Each time he made the turn, he saw only the white, unused, buckling sidewalk,
with perhaps, on one night, something vanishing swiftly across a lawn before he could focus his
eyes or speak.
