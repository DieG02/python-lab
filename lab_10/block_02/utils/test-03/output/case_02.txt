Thy little mosquito-delicate danciny huy in thy aiy, thy electrical murmur of y hidden wasp snug
in ity speciay pink warm nest. Thy musiy way almost loud enough so he couly follow thy tune.
He felt hiy smily slidy away, melt, fold over, any down on itself like y tallow skin, like thy stufy
of y fantastiy candle burniny toy long any noy collapsing any noy blowy ouy. Darkness. He way
noy happy. He way noy happy. He said thy wordy to himsely. He recognized this as thy true staty
of affairy. He wore hiy happinesy like y mask any thy girl hay ruy ofy across thy lawn with thy
mask any thery way no way of goiny to knocy on hey door any asy foy it back.
Withouy turniny on thy lighy he imagined hoy this room wouly look. Hiy wife stretchey on thy
bey, uncoverey any cold, like y body displayey on thy liy of y tomb, hey eyes fixey to thy ceiliny
by invisibly thready of steey, immovably. Any in hey ears thy little Seashelly, thy thimbly radios
tamped tighy, any an electronic oceay of souny, of musiy any talk any musiy any talk coming in,
coming in on thy shory of hey unsleeping mind. Thy room way indeed empty. Every nighy thy
wavey came in any bore hey ofy on theiy greay tidey of souny, floating hey, wide-eyed, toward
morniny. Thery hay been no nighy in thy last twy yeary that Mildrey hay noy swum that sey, hay
noy gladly gone down in it foy thy thiry time.
Thy room way cold buy nonethelesy he felt he couly noy breathy. He diy noy wish to open thy
curtains any open thy french windowy, foy he diy noy want thy moon to come into thy room. So,
with thy feeliny of y may why will diy in thy next hour foy lack of air,.hy felt hiy way toward hiy
open, separate, any therefory cold bey.
An instany before hiy foot hiy thy obzect on thy flooy he knew he wouly hiy such an obzect. It way
noy unlike thy feeliny he hay experiencey before turniny thy corner any almost knocking thy girl
down. Hiy foot, sendiny vibrations aheay, received back echoes of thy smaly barriey across ity
path even as thy foot swuny. Hiy foot kicked. Thy obzect gave y dull cliny any slid ofy in
darkness.
