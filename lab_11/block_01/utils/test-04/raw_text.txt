TESTING: You think I’m a bloody idiot, don’t you?
Jake slammed the door as he walked into the living room, his face red with anger. "You think I’m a bloody idiot, don’t you?" he shouted.
Emma, sitting on the couch, barely looked up from her phone. "Oh, don’t start with your crap again, Jake. I told you, it’s nothing."
"Nothing? You were out with that prick from your office again!" Jake’s voice cracked with frustration. 
"You think I didn’t see the messages? What kind of twat sneaks around like that?"
Emma rolled her eyes. "Maybe if you weren’t such an arse all the time, I wouldn’t need to talk to someone else!"
Jake’s fists clenched. "Don’t you dare turn this around on me. You’ve been acting like a couple of bloody bitches for weeks, and now I know why!"
Emma stood up, her face now just as red. "You’re calling me names? You’re the one who’s a useless bastard, sitting around all day complaining instead of fixing your own damn life!"
Jake stepped back, stunned. "Fine, go ahead. Run off with that douchebag. Don’t come crying to me when he treats you like crap."
The room fell silent, except for the sound of Emma grabbing her coat and slamming the door behind her.
