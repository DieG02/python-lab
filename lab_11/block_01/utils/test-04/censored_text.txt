TESTING: You think I’m a ****** *****, don’t you?
Jake slammed the door as he walked into the living room, his face red with anger. "You think I’m a ****** *****, don’t you?" he shouted.
Emma, sitting on the couch, barely looked up from her phone. "Oh, don’t start with your **** again, Jake. I told you, it’s nothing."
"Nothing? You were out with that ***** from your office again!" Jake’s voice cracked with frustration.
"You think I didn’t see the messages? What kind of **** sneaks around like that?"
Emma rolled her eyes. "Maybe if you weren’t such an **** all the time, I wouldn’t need to talk to someone else!"
Jake’s fists clenched. "Don’t you dare turn this around on me. You’ve been acting like a couple of ****** *****es for weeks, and now I know why!"
Emma stood up, her face now just as red. "You’re calling me names? You’re the one who’s a useless *******, sitting around all day complaining instead of fixing your own **** life!"
Jake stepped back, stunned. "Fine, go ahead. Run off with that ******bag. Don’t come crying to me when he treats you like ****."
The room fell silent, except for the sound of Emma grabbing her coat and slamming the door behind her.
